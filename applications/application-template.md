## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful Mintbase grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

**- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).**

Beamit.space is an app located right at the nexus of 4 trends in decentralized technology: The open Metaverse, Artificial Intelligence, Digital Identity and interchain. Breaking the barriers of siloing of open metaverse worlds, beamit.space with the help of cutting edge AI modelsmakes it easy for users and projects to create and send 3D avatars into any possible digital realm, lowering the cost of creation and deployment by 10x, and decreasing time of creation by a 100x.

Making use of cutting edge AI and machine learning models, beamit.space will enable anyone to convert PFP, NFTs, ordinals or eleven real life images to metaverse ready, controllable 3D avatars. Optimizing these models for any metaverse world, using beamit.space is a game changer in the realization of consistent digital identities across the open metaverse, lowering the barries, acting as a transforming beam into any meta-realm.

Further,by providing proof of provenance, beamit.space also helps maintaining the value of NFTs, contributing to the maintenance of the digital identity for the holder and user.

- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem.

Our project introduces a groundbreaking ai-enabled 3D avatar minting platform, designed to seamlessly integrate into and enrich the Mintbase/NEAR ecosystem. Leveraging NEAR's high-performance blockchain, our platform ensures an eco-friendly, cost-effective, and user-centric minting experience. By partnering with Mintbase, we enable our users to mint, trade, and explore 3D avatars in a vibrant NFT marketplace, fostering a new level of engagement and digital identity expression.

Our initiative aims to attract a diverse community, from virtual reality enthusiasts to digital artists, expanding the NEAR ecosystem's reach and utility. The introduction of customizable, high-fidelity ai-generated interchain 3D avatars opens up novel avenues for digital interaction and ownership, setting a new standard for 3D NFT utility. Users will be able to mint 3D Avatars from their PFP/NFTs they hold on any chain, and mint on NEAR. They also will be able to mint 3D Avatars generated from NFTS on Near to any other blockchain we integrated. therefore we are loweing the barriers of interacting with NEAR, and attracting new users to NEar, and extending utilit for Near NFTS generally.

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

Our team is passionate about bringing cutting edge AI to the open metaverse. Driving mass adoption by increasing utility of any NFT PFP collection is our contribution to this exciting industry.

### Project Details


- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
Please check this visualisation: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w6pC2u0ZUQvCqXpYqA19MYRYLUF07NZB/view?usp=sharing

- overview of the technology stack to be used
For the creation of 3D Avatars, Beamit.Space is using various AI models based on the open source machine learning framework Pytorch. Related to NFTs and smart contracts, the team is using coinweb protocol to build an interoperable decentralized application that allows deployment on multiple blockchains and L2, as well as integration with the requirements of various open metaverse projects.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in USN, and potentially NEAR and nUSDC, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
